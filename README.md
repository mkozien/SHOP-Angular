## App description

The app consists of two separate interfaces which are defined by the type of the user logged. The default page is login page, which also has a link to register page for the users who do not have their accounts yet. Depending on whether you will log in as a customer or as a seller, the app will navigate you to the page that allow you to buy products or manipulate the stock.

### Login and registration

#### Login page

This part of the app is a simple form made up of inputs for login and password and drop-down list defining the type of the user (customer or shop). After filling in the form, you can log in to the app by clicking the button below. In case of having typed the incorrect data, relevant message will pop up. At the bottom of the form you can find the link to the registration page.

#### Registration page

In this part of the app you can find a form including the inputs for the relevant user data. All the required fields are marked with asterisk. The inputs for e-mail and phone number require specific patterns - consecutively email pattern and the pattern made up of numbers. In case of having typed the invalid data, the border of the particular input will become red. Once you correctly fill in the form, you can complete the registration process by clicking the button below. The page will automatically navigate you to the login page. If you already have an account, you can navigate to the login page by using the link underneath the button.

### Customer interface

#### Navbar

When you log in as a customer, you can see a navbar at the top of the app. The navbar consists of 2 elements on the left and one element on the right. The elements on the left side are drop-down menus relating to, sequentially, shopping activities and account management. Under the shopping drop-down menu you can choose between the links to the shopping basket, list of products and shopping history, whereas the my account drop-down menu consists of the navigation to the forms allowing you to change your password and other data as well as the 'logout' button. On the right side there is a simple welcome message including the login of the user.

#### Shopping menu

###### Products
This is a default page rendered after having logged in as a customer. On the screen you can see the table of all products available on the platform. You have access to the following product information: name, price, currency, type and the shop it comes from. On the right side of each row there is an icon that lets you add the product to the shopping basket. 
On the right sight of the page you can see a small table representing the products already added to the basket. It informs you about the name and price of the product you are to buy as well as the quantity of each product. In the last row you can see the total cost of all products you want to purchase. The quantity of each product can be manipulated by the respective icons in each row. You can decrement the quantity (bag dash icon), increment it (bag plus icon) or even delete the whole row by clicking the trash icon. At the bottom of the table you can find two buttons. The red button removes all products from the basket, whereas the green one is responsible for completing the purchase of all products added to the basket.

###### Basket
In this part of the app you can see the extended version of the basket visible on the previously mentioned page. Just as in the small version of the shopping basket, you can manipulate the quantity of each product, delete the products you change your mind about, clear the basket or complete the purchase. The only change relates to the information of the products added to the basket. Except for the name, price and quantity it also informs you of the currency, product type and the shop it belongs to.
